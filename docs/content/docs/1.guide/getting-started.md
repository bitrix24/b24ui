The goal of this project is to provide components identical to Bitrix24 to enhance the user experience and simplify the development of applications for Bitrix24.

We have chosen [Nuxt UI v3](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/) as the foundation.

Under the hood we have the following frameworks:
- [@bitrix24/b24style](https://bitrix24.github.io/b24style/)
- [@bitrix24/b24icons](https://bitrix24.github.io/b24icons/)
- [@bitrix24/b24jssdk](https://bitrix24.github.io/b24jssdk/)
- [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/)
- TypeScript Integration
- Vue compatibility

We are just beginning our journey, and there is still much work ahead in writing and testing.

But we have already taken the first step.

Join us!
