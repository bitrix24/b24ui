## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS uses a CSS-first configuration, letting you define your design tokens with the [`@theme`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#theme-directive) directive directly in your CSS. This makes your theme portable, maintainable and easy to customize.

```css [app/assets/css/main.css]
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@bitrix24/b24ui-nuxt";

@theme {
  /* Your custom design tokens go here */
}
```

::note{to="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme/" target="_blank"}
Check the Tailwind CSS documentation for all available theme variable customization options.

### Breakpoints

Use the `--breakpoint-*` theme variables to [customize your breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#customizing-your-theme).

```css [app/assets/css/main.css]
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@bitrix24/b24ui-nuxt";

@theme {
  --breakpoint-3xl: 1920px;
  --breakpoint-4xl: 2560px;
  --breakpoint-5xl: 3840px;
}
```
