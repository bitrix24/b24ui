## What is Bitrix24 UI?

A Vue UI library for Bitrix24 based on [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com). This modern Vue UI library, based on [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/), allows you to create beautiful and accessible applications with over 100 ready-to-use components.

If you're building a Vue project with Tailwind CSS, Bitrix24 UI is a great default choice. It provides high-level, ready-to-use components (data tables, forms, overlays, navigation) while still allowing advanced customization when needed.

## Core technologies

### Reka UI

Bitrix24 UI is built on top of [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/) as a foundation for the components:

- **WAI-ARIA Compliance**: Follows [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://reka-ui.com/docs/overview/accessibility) with proper semantics and roles
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Built-in keyboard support for complex components like tabs and dialogs
- **Focus Management**: Intelligent focus handling that moves focus based on user interactions
- **Accessible Labels**: Abstractions to simplify labeling controls for screen readers

### Tailwind CSS

Bitrix24 UI integrates the latest [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), bringing significant improvements:

- **5x Faster Builds**: Full builds up to 5x faster, incremental builds over 100x faster
- **Unified Toolchain**: Built-in import handling, vendor prefixing, and syntax transforms
- **CSS-first Configuration**: Customize and extend directly in CSS instead of JavaScript
- **Modern Web Features**: Container queries, cascade layers, wide-gamut colors, and more

### Tailwind Variants

Bitrix24 UI takes advantage of [Tailwind Variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) to provide a powerful design system:

- **Dynamic Styling**: Flexible component variants with a powerful API
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with auto-completion
- **Conflict Resolution**: Efficient merging of conflicting styles
