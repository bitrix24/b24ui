## Usage

The DashboardGroup component is the main layout that wraps the [DashboardSidebar](/docs/components/dashboard-sidebar/) and [DashboardPanel](/docs/components/dashboard-panel/) components to create a responsive dashboard interface.

Use it in a layout or in your `app.vue`:

```vue [layouts/dashboard.vue]{2,6}
<template>
  <B24DashboardGroup>
    <B24DashboardSidebar />

    <slot />
  </B24DashboardGroup>
</template>
```
