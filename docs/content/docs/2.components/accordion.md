## Examples

### Control active item(s)

You can control the active item(s) by using the `default-value` prop or the `v-model` directive with the index of the item.

::component-example
---
name: 'accordion-model-value-example'
props:
  class: 'px-4'
---
::

::tip
You can also pass the `value` of one of the items if provided.
::

::caution
When `type="multiple"`, ensure to pass an array to the `default-value` prop or the `v-model` directive.
::

### With drag and drop

Use the [`useSortable`](https://vueuse.org/integrations/useSortable/) composable from [`@vueuse/integrations`](https://vueuse.org/integrations/README.html) to enable drag and drop functionality on the Accordion. This integration wraps [Sortable.js](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) to provide a seamless drag and drop experience.

::component-example
---
name: 'accordion-drag-and-drop-example'

### With body slot

Use the `#body` slot to customize the body of each item.

::component-example
---
name: 'accordion-body-slot-example'
props:
  class: 'px-4'
---
::

::tip
The `#body` slot includes some pre-defined styles, use the [`#content` slot](#with-content-slot) if you want to start from scratch.
::

### With content slot

Use the `#content` slot to customize the content of each item.

::component-example
---
name: 'accordion-content-slot-example'
props:
  class: 'px-4'

::

### With custom slot

Use the `slot` property to customize a specific item.

You will have access to the following slots:

- `#{{ item.slot }}`{lang="ts-type"}
- `#{{ item.slot }}-body`{lang="ts-type"}

::component-example
---
name: 'accordion-custom-slot-example'
props:
  class: 'px-4'
---
::

### With markdown content

You can use the [MDC](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc?tab=readme-ov-file#mdc) component from `@nuxtjs/mdc` to render markdown in the accordion items.

::component-example
---
collapse: true
