## Usage

This component implements Reka UI [ConfigProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/utilities/config-provider) to provide global configuration to all components:

- Enables all primitives to inherit global reading direction.
- Enables changing the behavior of scroll body when setting body lock.
- Much more controls to prevent layout shifts.

It's also using [ToastProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/components/toast#provider) and [TooltipProvider](https://reka-ui.com/docs/components/tooltip#provider) to provide global toasts and tooltips.

Use it as at the root of your app:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <B24App>
    <NuxtPage />
  </B24App>
</template>
```
